# Project 3 

The objective of this project was to build two models in an Express/Mongo Server and One have Full CRUD and a second have Add/Delete.

#Flip Cards

Welcome to Flip Cards, an App that stores your flash cards in Decks. 
"Well thats pretty common..." consumers say, "What sets you apart?"
Well we are easy to fill out and view! 
Easy to Delete or Add as many cards as you want!
One sheet you can tab through to fill out or edit your cards. 
Also to flip our cards you just click or mouse over! 
We have colors for our cards and their fonts and out cards can be resized and our font can too!

-- Try using us for studying, Memorizing acting lines, 'spice up' your "about me"'s at the start of a next talk, Teachers use us to introduce a topic or to make multiplication tables more fun! --
What do you put on your FlipCards?
